This is an implimentation of networks built with the neuron model proposed in Nature Physics 6, 801 (2010).
Usage of it is as the follows:
1) make and run the main file (the presented results are with f_e=40 Hz).
2) Causal.py caculates size and duration distribution of the causal avalanches.
3) Timebin.py generates size and duration distribution of the time-bin avalanches.
4) Branchingrate.py calculates the causal branching rate.
5) To generate a new network, compile and run network.cpp. Due to randomness of connections, sometimes the branching rate can deviate from 1.
   Rebuild the network in this case. copy the screen-printed number to the csize varialbe in main.cpp, which is the number of total connections in the network.
   Then, 1) make and run the main file.
6) bufurcation.cpp generates the postsynaptic firing rate of a presynaptic firing rate for a single layer based on analytical solution of the model.
7) LIAvalanche.py plots the proportion of left inclined avalanches.
